# Class three assignments

## Assignment 1 - Sales tax calculator
Goal: Get the total cost of an item that costs $78 + its tax
Write a function that I can input the cost, and breaks down each tax amount:
- New York State Tax (4%)
- New York City Tax (4.5%)
- MTA Tax (0.375%)

It should print out in the console as
- Total cost: $X
- Total sales tax: $X
- NYS Tax: $X
- NYC Tax: $X
- MTA Tax: $X

## Assignment 2 – Split array by data type

Goal: Sort data by its type and order it 

Sort the number and string arrays
- Numbers by lowest to highest
- Strings by alphabetical order

Console log all three arrays

Things to remember
- You’ll want to use the the reverse()/sort() or the toSorted()/toReversed() functions in javascript for the second part
